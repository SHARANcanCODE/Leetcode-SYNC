# LeetCode Sync Tool

## What is this project?

LeetCode Sync Tool is a Python-based automation project that:
- Fetches your accepted LeetCode submissions using LeetCode's web API with session authentication.
- Saves accepted solutions locally into a clean folder structure sorted by difficulty and problem tags.
- Automatically commits and pushes these changes to a GitHub repository.
- Supports scheduled periodic syncing (e.g., daily) to keep your local codebase and GitHub repo up-to-date.

## Use Case

This tool is ideal for developers who:
- Want to maintain an organized local backup of their LeetCode solutions.
- Want to showcase their data structures & algorithms (DSA) skills with real solved problems in a structured way on GitHub.
- Desire automation that integrates coding practice with GitHub portfolio updates without manual effort.

## How it Demonstrates Skills

- Deep integration with LeetCode's unofficial GraphQL API and web API.
- Uses Python for API interaction, data parsing, and file management.
- Automates Git using GitPython for commit and push workflows.
- Implements modular, clean, and scalable code architecture.
- Shows real-world tool-building and scheduling using Python scheduling libraries.
- Securely manages sensitive credentials via environment variables.
